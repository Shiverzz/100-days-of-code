# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Built the Random Quote App, a project from FreeCodeCamp and started to code the Local Weather App. Also a project from FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts:** At first, I had some problems dealing with the api I was working with because Google Chrome would allow only "secure sources" only or whatever. But as soon as i put my code on CodePen, it worked and didn't give me any error output so I am really satisfied.

### Day 2: January 5,2017 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Local Weather App and made some progress on FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts**: Had some problems with geoLocation. Apparently, browsers won't support geolocation on "not safe sources" which means only HTTPS websites can use it right now. From what i've searched, HTTPS websites use SSL encription so that makes them more secure. For that reason, i've been forced to find an API to get the coordinates on the client-side and found this one: http://ip-api.com/json; solved all of my problems !
