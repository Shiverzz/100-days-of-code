# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Built the Random Quote App, a project from FreeCodeCamp and started to code the Local Weather App. Also a project from FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts:** At first, I had some problems dealing with the api I was working with because Google Chrome would allow only "secure sources" only or whatever. But as soon as i put my code on CodePen, it worked and didn't give me any error output so I am really satisfied.

### Day 2: January 5,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Local Weather App and made some progress on FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts**: Had some problems with geoLocation. Apparently, browsers won't support geolocation on "not safe sources" which means only HTTPS websites can use it right now. From what i've searched, HTTPS websites use SSL encription so that makes them more secure. For that reason, i've been forced to find an API to get the coordinates on the client-side and found this one: http://ip-api.com/json; solved all of my problems !

### Day 3: January 6,2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Wiki Viewer" App, couldn't finish though

**Thoughts**: I am finally perceiving the experience I'm getting from developing these projects. It gave me the chance to make mistakes and to fix those mistakes. And I'm sure I won't make those mistakes again; and that, if I do, I will be able to fix them right away. Today I couldn't finish the project like in the previous days but I'm really proud of myself because this project I thought to be harder than the previous ones and I've been able to overcome and get the logic to work with it.

### Day 4: January 8,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Twitch App

**Thoughts**: My programming logic is getting much better from when I started this challenge.

### Day 5: January 13,2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some Javascript exercises!

**Thoughts**: These challenges are getting a lot harder! Some of them, i was only able to solve after hours of searching and trying. But I was able to finish about 10 of them. The reason I skipped some days is because i was at a cousin's house and wasn't able to keep track of my coding. I kept coding these days but didn't make any record about it so i'll not include them on this challenge and will continue from where i've left.

### Day 6: January 14,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic algorithm section on FreeCodeCamp and "drew" a bear using CSS and HTML only

**Thoughts**: These last challenges were really hard but nothing that time and clear thinking can't handle. 
I woke up today really well disposed, checked my mail and there it was: the first challenge of the #DailyCSSImages. It was a bear cub. I had never done anything similar so i had no idea from where to start so I found about the koala tutorial on DailyCssImages website and learned from it.Turns out it's a piece of cake. For real. I'm excited to see what's coming though.

### Day 7: January 15,2017

**Today's Progress**: 3 Intermediate javascript algorithms

**Thoughts**: Not a lot of progress today. To be honest, i wasn't in the mood to code so I coded just 3-4 hours. The "convert to roman number" challenge was really hard! Probably the hardest i have ever done in my whole life. I'm not really proud of my code because it got really big (140 lines of code) and i think there's a better solution for this challenge but as I said, i'm not really in the mood to code so i'll just make it a day
