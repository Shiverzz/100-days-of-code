# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Built the Random Quote App, a project from FreeCodeCamp and started to code the Local Weather App. Also a project from FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts:** At first, I had some problems dealing with the api I was working with because Google Chrome would allow only "secure sources" only or whatever. But as soon as i put my code on CodePen, it worked and didn't give me any error output so I am really satisfied.

### Day 2: January 5,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Local Weather App and made some progress on FreeCodeCamp's course

**Thoughts**: Had some problems with geoLocation. Apparently, browsers won't support geolocation on "not safe sources" which means only HTTPS websites can use it right now. From what i've searched, HTTPS websites use SSL encription so that makes them more secure. For that reason, i've been forced to find an API to get the coordinates on the client-side and found this one: http://ip-api.com/json; solved all of my problems !

### Day 3: January 6,2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Wiki Viewer" App, couldn't finish though

**Thoughts**: I am finally perceiving the experience I'm getting from developing these projects. It gave me the chance to make mistakes and to fix those mistakes. And I'm sure I won't make those mistakes again; and that, if I do, I will be able to fix them right away. Today I couldn't finish the project like in the previous days but I'm really proud of myself because this project I thought to be harder than the previous ones and I've been able to overcome and get the logic to work with it.

### Day 4: January 8,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Twitch App

**Thoughts**: My programming logic is getting much better from when I started this challenge.

### Day 5: January 13,2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some Javascript exercises!

**Thoughts**: These challenges are getting a lot harder! Some of them, i was only able to solve after hours of searching and trying. But I was able to finish about 10 of them. The reason I skipped some days is because i was at a cousin's house and wasn't able to keep track of my coding. I kept coding these days but didn't make any record about it so i'll not include them on this challenge and will continue from where i've left.

### Day 6: January 14,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic algorithm section on FreeCodeCamp and "drew" a bear using CSS and HTML only

**Thoughts**: These last challenges were really hard but nothing that time and clear thinking can't handle. 
I woke up today really well disposed, checked my mail and there it was: the first challenge of the #DailyCSSImages. It was a bear cub. I had never done anything similar so i had no idea from where to start so I found about the koala tutorial on DailyCssImages website and learned from it.Turns out it's a piece of cake. For real. I'm excited to see what's coming though.

### Day 7: January 15,2017

**Today's Progress**: 3 Intermediate javascript algorithms

**Thoughts**: Not a lot of progress today. To be honest, i wasn't in the mood to code so I coded just 3-4 hours. The "convert to roman number" challenge was really hard! Probably the hardest i have ever done in my whole life. I'm not really proud of my code because it got really big (140 lines of code) and i think there's a better solution for this challenge but as I said, i'm not really in the mood to code so i'll just call it a day

### Day 8: January 16,2017

**Today's Progress**: 0 intermediate javascript algorithm

**Thoughts**: >WHEREFORE ART THOU< this challenge is hard as ****. OMG, i've spent like 7 hrs trying to finish it but I still couldn't! Don't know what to say. Don't know if i get proud of myself for trying so hard or if i'm too dumb. I guess i'll go with the first one.

### Day 9: January 17,2017

**Today's Progress**: FINISHED WHEREFORE ART THOU and two more challenges. Had my first web dev job interview too!

**Thoughts**: Had my first interview today! I didn't get nervous so that helped me a lot. I think i went pretty well but it was my first experience so i'm not a good judge. The projects i've been doing helped me a lot because it showed that i am capable of getting the job done and they are making me a more dedicated person also.

### Day 13: January 21,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the intermediate Javascript algorithm challenges!

**Thoughts**: Didn't log for a few days but I kept coding, making some javascript algorithms and stuff. Today i've finished the intermediate section and now i'll go to the final projects starting from the "Javascript Calculator". After i finish these projects, I can receive my Front-End certificate so I'm really excited for it! Day 18 I've received my college entrance examination grade and i'm really happy with it!

### Day 14: January 22,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Javascript Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: Today, I finished the Javascript Calculator and I didn't find it hard. I think that this is a good thing because it shows that the javascript challenges prepared me well enough for this first project and for the next ones, I hope.

### Day 14: January 23,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the design for the Pomodoro Clock App

**Thoughts**: Today i finished the design for the Pomodoro Clock which took about 1 hr to finish. Didn't have much time to code cause I had a few appointments that couldn't be avoided.

### Day 15: January 24,2017

**Today's Progress**: Went to a meetup

**Thoughts**: Today i went to a Ruby workshop and learned a lot about the language. From what I seen, it looks a lot simpler than Javascript and also has methods that really helps the coder. Really excited to get to learn more about the language! The workshop was really great, Le Wagon really do a great job.

### Day 16 and 17: January 25/26,2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Pomodoro clock!

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the Pomodoro Clock App! Had a few problems that i couldn't solve such as pausing the timer and then being able to continue from where it started...But i think that that's no big deal because the point of the pomodoro clock is to not stop your work until the timer finishes. Tomorrow i start the tic tac toe game and i'm looking forward to it
